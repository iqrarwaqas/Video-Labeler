# Video Speaker Labeler

A small Windows desktop app for labeling **who speaks first** in each video: the **on-screen** actor or the **off-screen** speaker.
The label tells the model which diarized audio track belongs to the on-screen actor (diarization tags the first speaker as **A**):

| Who speaks first | On-screen actor's diarized track |
|---|---|
| On-screen  | **A** |
| Off-screen | **B** |
| Unclear    | (blank; leave it out of training) |

The app has two tools, picked on the start screen:

1. **Video Splitter**: cut long videos (30–50+ min, where the off-screen speaker keeps changing) into short clips. See [Split long videos](#split-long-videos).
2. **Video Labeler**: label who speaks first in each clip. See [How to label](#how-to-label).

The **⌂** button at the top left goes back to the start screen. An open project stays open, so you can switch between the tools.

## Install (Windows app)

1. Download `VideoLabeler-Setup-<version>.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/iqrarwaqas/Video-Labeler/releases/latest) and run it. No admin rights are needed.
2. Start **Video Speaker Labeler** from the Start menu. The app opens in its own window; close the window to quit.

The app uses the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime, which comes with Windows 11 and up-to-date Windows 10.

**Updates:** the app checks for a new version when it starts and shows a banner when one is available. You can also check at any time with **⚙ Settings → Check for updates** (or **Check for updates** on the start screen). Click **Update now**: the app closes, installs the new version and reopens. Your labels and settings are kept.

**Theme:** pick **System**, **Light** or **Dark** in **⚙ Settings**. **System** follows the Windows setting.

Windows may show "Windows protected your PC" because the installer isn't code-signed. Click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Setup from source (once)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py --videos "D:\data\videos" --project "Batch_01"
```

The app opens in its own window. With `--videos`, the labeler opens straight away. You can also run `python main.py` with no arguments, pick a tool on the start screen and fill in the folders there (**Browse** opens a folder picker). The app remembers the last folders you used in each tool.

Options:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--videos DIR` | Folder with the videos (`.mp4 .mov .webm .mkv .avi .m4v`) |
| `--project NAME` | Project name, shown in the app and used for the output file name (default: the videos folder name) |
| `--output DIR` | Where `<project>_labels.xlsx` is written (default: an `output` folder next to the videos folder) |
| `--import FILE` | Seed labels from the old sheet (`Video_Name`, `Onscreen_Speaker` = a/b). Existing labels are never overwritten. |
| `--browser` | Open the app in the web browser instead of its own window |
| `--port N` | Port of the local server (default 5000) |
| `--host 0.0.0.0` | Let other PCs on the network open the app in their browser at `http://<this-pc>:<port>` |

## Split long videos

1. On the start screen, click **Video Splitter**. Pick the folder with the long videos and an **output (dataset) folder** for the clips. The output folder can't be the same as the long-videos folder.
2. Pick a video in the sidebar and play it. Mark the parts you want to keep on the timeline:
   - **Ranges:** press `I` (**Start**) where a part begins and `O` (**End**) where it ends. Everything between segments is left out.
   - **Markers:** press `M` to drop a split marker, then click **Segments from markers**. This cuts the whole video into back-to-back pieces at the markers (parts that overlap an existing segment are skipped). Delete the pieces you don't want.
3. Fine-tune: drag a segment to move it, drag its edges to resize it (the video shows the frame at the edge), or type exact times in the segment list (`1:02:03.500`, `2:03.5` or `123.5`). Segments can't overlap. Double-click a segment, or click ▶ in the list, to play just that segment.
4. Click **Export clips**. Each segment is saved as its own MP4, numbered in time order: `interview.mp4` → `interview_1.mp4`, `interview_2.mp4`, … You can cancel at any time. Clips that are already finished are kept.
5. Click **Open in Labeler** to label the new clips. The labeler setup opens with the output folder filled in.

Shortcuts: `Space` play/pause · `←` / `→` 5 s back/forward (`Shift`: 1 s) · `,` / `.` one frame · `I` / `O` start/end · `M` marker · `Delete` delete the selected segment or marker · `Ctrl+Z` undo · `Ctrl`+mouse wheel or `+` / `-` zoom · `0` show the whole video · `Esc` cancel a started segment.

Notes:

- **Cuts are frame-accurate.** Clips are re-encoded to H.264/AAC MP4, so they always play in the labeler. This takes time: about 1–3 minutes of work for every 10 minutes of clips, depending on the PC.
- **Your segments are saved as you work**, in `_splits.json` in the output folder. Open the same folders again to continue. The file also records which part of which source video every exported clip came from.
- **Exporting a video again replaces its old clips.** The app asks first. Old clips that aren't in the new segment list are deleted, so the clips always match the segments.
- The sidebar dot is blue when a video has exported clips and hollow when it has segments that aren't exported yet.
- ffmpeg comes with the Windows app. When you run from source, `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs it (`imageio-ffmpeg`). If that isn't possible, an `ffmpeg` on PATH is used instead.

## How to label

1. Watch the video.
2. Click **On-screen**, **Off-screen** or **Unclear / Skip** (or press `1` / `2` / `3`).
3. The label is saved straight away and the next video opens.

Shortcuts: `←` / `→` previous/next · `Space` play/pause · `R` replay · `N` next unlabeled video.
The sidebar lists every video with a colored dot (green = on-screen, orange = off-screen, grey = unclear), with a count per label. Use **All / To do / Done** to filter the list. **⚙ Settings → Show labels file** opens the output folder with the Excel file selected.

**Resume:** open the same project again and the app continues at the first unlabeled video. If you go back to a video you already labeled, its label is highlighted. Click another option to change it, or click **Clear label**.

## Output: `output/<project>_labels.xlsx`

| Project | Video_Name | Video_File | First_Speaker | Onscreen_Diarized_Label | Labeled_At |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Batch_01 | video1 | video1.mp4 | onscreen | A | 2026-09-24 13:20:00 |
| Batch_01 | video4 | video4.mp4 | offscreen | B | 2026-09-24 13:21:10 |

- The file is updated after every click, and each video has only one row (changing a label updates that row).
- Each project has its own file, so several projects can share one output folder.
- If the output folder has an old `labels.xlsx` from before project names existed, its labels are copied into the first project you open there. The old file is left untouched.
- **Close the labels file in Excel while labeling.** Excel locks the file. If it's open, the app shows a warning and nothing is lost: close Excel and click the label again.
- Use one project per person. Two people must not label into the same project file at the same time.

## Troubleshooting

- **The app opens in the browser instead of its own window**: the WebView2 runtime is missing. Install it from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) and start the app again.
- **"This video can't be played here"**: `.avi` and some `.mkv`/`.mov` codecs can't be played. Convert them to MP4:
  `ffmpeg -i in.avi -c:v libx264 -c:a aac out.mp4`

## Releasing a new version (maintainers)

1. Update `__version__` in `main.py`, e.g. `"1.1.0"`, and commit.
2. Tag and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.0
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```
3. The **Release** GitHub Action builds `VideoLabeler-Setup-1.1.0.exe` and publishes it as a GitHub Release. Installed apps see the update the next time they start.

The tag must match `__version__`, or the build fails. The repo must be public so that installed apps can check for updates and download them.

To build the installer locally, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) and run:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller packaging/VideoLabeler.spec --noconfirm
iscc /DAppVersion=1.1.0 installer\VideoLabeler.iss
```

The installer is written to `dist/`.

The app icon is `packaging/icon.ico` (installer and `.exe`) and `static/icon.svg` (inside the app). If you change the design, update `static/icon.svg` and redraw the `.ico` with `python packaging/make_icon.py` (needs Pillow).
